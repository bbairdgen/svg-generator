  ## Description
  
  I created this project in order to better learn how to use OOP. This is a simple SVG logo generator. It is currently limited to only accetp 3 characters for the logo and can only handle s single shape of either a circle, triangle, or square. I actually did this project in two different ways. The first way I did it, I made it work without truly using OOP. I then worked with a tutor and was able to better understand how to use OOP to create the generator.
